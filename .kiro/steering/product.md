# Product Overview

Amigo is a WebSocket-based AI agent system that manages conversational workflows with task delegation capabilities. The system enables:

- Real-time bidirectional communication between frontend and backend via WebSocket
- Hierarchical task management with parent-child task relationships
- LLM-powered conversation management with streaming responses
- Tool-based extensibility for custom agent behaviors
- Persistent conversation history and state management
- Sub-agent spawning for parallel task execution

The architecture follows a client-server model where the frontend provides a chat interface while the backend orchestrates LLM interactions, tool execution, and conversation state persistence.
